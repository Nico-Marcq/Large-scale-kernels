# Large-scale-kernels

## Information
This is an implementation and comparison of computing tome & accuracy of 3 classification methods for large scale datasets: 
- Support Vector Classification (Linear and Gaussian kernel)
- Random kernel features https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/papers/07.rah.rec.nips.pdf
- Nystrom method

This work was done as part of the course at IMT (Institut Mines Telecom) on AI.

## Data Preparation
Please download the datasets from LIBSVM datasets http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets
We already have the ijcnn1.tr (training) and ijcnn1.t (testing) set in the folder.
